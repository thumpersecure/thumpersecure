## Telespot ecosystem

Phone -> OSINT -> opt-out workflow:

```text
Telespot (CLI) -> Telespotter (Rust) -> TelespotXX (Web)
                          |
                          +-> xTELENUMSINT (Chrome extension)
                          +-> TeleSTOP (Desktop opt-out)
```

## How it works

**Site uses a snapshot generated by GitHub Actions** — no client-side API calls required. A scheduled workflow (`scripts/build_snapshot.js`) fetches repo data daily and commits it to `docs/data/site_snapshot.json`. The frontend loads this static file with a 3-tier fallback (snapshot → localStorage cache → embedded fallback), so the site never shows zeros or broken states.

### Features

- **Collapsible modules** — 8 sections with animated expand/collapse and a global toggle
- **Music player** — Mute toggle, 3 tracks with autoplay, playlist auto-advance, preferences persist in localStorage
- **AI defense effects** — Optional fictional [SIMULATION]/[DEMO] toast notifications (toggle on/off)
- **Puzzles** — 3 opt-in mini-games that unlock bonus content (skip available, state persists)
- **Search/filter** — Full-text search across the recipe index
- **Accessibility** — Keyboard navigation, focus rings, ARIA attributes, reduced motion support
- **SEO** — Sitemap, robots.txt, Open Graph tags, JSON-LD structured data

### Audio setup

Place local audio files in `docs/` or `docs/assets/audio/`. Track 1 (Tron) uses a local `.m4a` file. Tracks 2–3 fall back to iTunes 30-second previews if no local files are provided. See `docs/assets/audio/README.md` for details.

### Settings

All user preferences are stored under `ts_cookbook_settings` in localStorage. Open the ⚙ Settings panel to toggle effects, reset puzzles, or enable dev mode.
