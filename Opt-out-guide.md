🛡️ Opt-Out Guide (People Search / Data Broker Sites)

A visual, step-by-step guide to remove your info from common people-search sites.

🚀 Quick Start
	1.	Find your profile on the site (search your name + city/state).
	2.	Copy the exact profile URL.
	3.	Use the site’s opt-out page and submit removal.
	4.	Confirm via email/phone if required.
	5.	Re-check in 24–72 hours and repeat if multiple listings appear.

✅ Before You Begin (Checklist)
	•	Use a fresh browser tab (incognito/private helps).
	•	Have your email ready (some sites require confirmation).
	•	Keep a notes file with: site + profile URL + date submitted.
	•	If you’re listed multiple times, you usually must remove each listing separately.

🧰 Pro Tips
	•	🧠 Search smarter: try "First Last" + city and also just phone number.
	•	🧹 Clear cookies or use private mode if the site loops or blocks.
	•	🔁 Set a reminder to re-check in 7–14 days (some sites republish).
	•	📸 Screenshot confirmations for your records.
